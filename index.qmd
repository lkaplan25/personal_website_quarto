## Hi, I'm Leah.

*(pronounced lay-uh\...yes, like the Star Wars character)*

I want to understand how we can better leverage emerging transportation technologies for the benefit of, rather than detriment to, society.

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering](http://emse.seas.gwu.edu/) at the George Washington University and a Fellow with GWU's [Co-Design of Trustworthy AI Systems NSF Research Traineeship](https://dtais.seas.gwu.edu/). My current research focuses on the potential societal impacts of automated vehicles, with an emphasis on equity and labor.
